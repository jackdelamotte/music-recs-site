A simple static website to display some music recommendations and practice HTML/CSS!

Although this site is no longer being hosted on the web, it was a really hekpful way for
me to dive into learning some basic HTML and CSS concepts, especially flexbox!

Thanks for reading and hopefully you enjoy the music recommendations!
